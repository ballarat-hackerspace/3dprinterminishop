3D Printing "Minishop"

#A Mini workshop made for demonstrations

##Layout
.md files could be converted using markdown2impressjs converter, shown with intro.md first, then the demo.md file.

###Preperation
Create a few shapes before the Workshop, to allow for them to be passed around. A "Fast" (.3mm Layer height) and "Slow" (.1mm Layer height) make for good comparisons.
Thingiverse is a good source for shapes to print, otherwise make a logo for your hackerspace/group for promotion.

Prepare a few files ready to print, and utilize multiple printers if you have them available for contrasting speed, adhesion, or other settings you have found helpful while learning 3D Printing.
