Demonstration
=============

* Printers at the hackerspace are based on the i3 Prusa design
* Open source, many changes in the community

We are going to start various prints at once to compare their print quality and speed for you.

Quality
=======
The smaller the layer height, the more detail you can put into the height.

* Sample prints hand out
* by printing in a different orientation, you can work to the strengths of the X and Y being higher res, which leads to...

Supports and Adhesion
=====================

We are going to print a variety of files (aim for 30-40 minute print time), with differing settings

* Supports
- Enable gaps or "mid air" bridging

* Adhesion
- Most common problem with ABS is the filament contracts too early, moving off the bed.
-- Brim
-- Raft

* Multiple Filament
- a grid of bHack coins with a filament change near the top.

Making a 3D Print
=================
* Documentary on the projector to watch about 3D Printing
* Live Simplify3D Demonstration people can observe more technical side.
- Simplify 3D Run through of how to do those things being printed, other common tips
